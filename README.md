TimePrimitive
====

TimePrimitive is a Java API used by [FIMS](https://github.com/isl/FIMS). It implements a primitive time data type. An interval-based time model is adopted.  Users declare temporal elements through certain temporal expressions
that follow the rules of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus. These expressions are parsed and converted into two integers, the lower and the upper boundaries of the corresponding arithmetic interval. Upon recall of a temporal 
element the system reconstructs the exact temporal expression.


Build - Run
====
Folders src contain all the files needed to build and create a jar file.

Usage
====
Conversion of time expression into two integers:
/**
 * Parameterized constructor
 * must call with expression as parameter
 * @param expr
 */
public SISdate(String expr):

/**
 * getFromTo 
 * returns integer array with lower value 
 * in position 0 and upper value in position 1
 * @return
 */
public int[] getFromTo() ;
	
/**
 * returns lower field of class
 * @return
 */
public int getFrom();
	
	
/**
 * returns upper field of class
 * @return
 */
public int getTo();

Reconstruct the exact temporal expression from two integers:
/**
 * Parameterized constructor
 * reconstructs temporal expression
 * based on from, to values 
 * lang (Greek or English)
 * @param from
 * @param to
 * @param lang
 */
public SISdate (int from,int to,Language lang);

/**
 * Returnâ€™s reconstructed temporal Expression
 * @return
 */
public String getFullText();
